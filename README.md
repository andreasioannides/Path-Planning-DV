This is the Path Planning pipeline for an autonomous Formula student racing car.

Given a race track, this pipeline extracts the points at which the racing car will pass. The implementation combines Random Rapidly Exploring Trees (RRT) and Delaunay triangulation algorithms for space discretization and exploration.
